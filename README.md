# Talking (to) Things
## A comparative exploration of voice assistants as assistive technologies for blind people

This research proposal explores the potentials of voice assistant technologies for the blind, the extent to which this technology can provide and assist access to the world, and how their design could be improved to serve the specific needs of the target demographic and avoid risky situations.

This repository holds the raw and compiled material for my MA Design thesis, with a focus on design research. You can access the final product under [MA Thesis - Talking (to) Things](MA%20Thesis%20-%20Talking%20(to)%20Things.pdf).

## Working process
I wrote the whole document in markdown with Visual Studio Code. I used to write with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which is super comfortable and I encourage everybody to try it if you're still searching for the right writer's tool. Since I'm also a software developer I'm quite comfortable with a code IDE. I found the [foam plugin](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to be a great replacement for the basics I need in a Zettelkasten, which basically is working with Wikilinks.

I also used the following plugins for vscode:

- [Markdown Footnote](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=houkanshan.vscode-markdown-footnote)
- [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
- [Pandoc Citer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=notZaki.pandocciter)
- [vscode-pandoc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DougFinke.vscode-pandoc)

Especially the latter two are very important, since they enable me to access my Zotero BibTex export and render a proper bibliography. In my opinion this plugin is superior to the Obsidian Citation plugin, since you can define the bibliography file in the markdown matter.

I exported to docx with the help of pandoc. It produced the cleanest version of the document. After that I applied styles I save within Word and did some final layouting. The photo layout is probably the part I'm least proud of. But I can't do everything, can't I ;) ?
