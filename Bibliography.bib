  abstract = {In time, phenomenology has become a viable approach to conducting qualitative studies in education. Popular and well-established methods include descriptive and hermeneutic phenomenology. Based on critiques of the essentialism and receptivity of these two methods, however, this article offers a third variation of empirical phenomenology: Postphenomenology. The article introduces postphenomenology, a philosophy of technology that highlights the importance of technological mediation of experience: Technologies transform our perceptions (amplify/reduce) and translate our actions (invite/inhibit). Based on this framework, two approaches to empirical fieldwork are suggested: In-depth exploration of the typical use of a given technology and critical comparison of multiple versions of a technology. It is argued that using postphenomenology as a research method helps researchers explore technological mediation, a vital and oft-neglected aspect of educational practice, but the method simultaneously entails epistemological commitments such as multistability, reflexivity, and posthumanism. The article concludes by discussing future challenges for the postphenomenological method.},

  abstract = {Agency is the capacity of an actor to act in a given environment. The capacity to act does not at first imply a specific moral dimension to the ability to make the choice to act, and moral agency is therefore a distinct concept. In sociology, an agent is an individual engaging with the social structure. Notably, though, the primacy of social structure vs. individual capacity with regard to persons' actions is debated within sociology. This debate concerns, at least partly, the level of reflexivity an agent may possess.Agency may either be classified as unconscious, involuntary behavior, or purposeful, goal directed activity (intentional action). An agent typically has some sort of immediate awareness of their physical activity and the goals that the activity is aimed at realizing. In `goal directed action' an agent implements a kind of direct control or guidance over their own behavior.},

  abstract = {We have no interest whatever in minimizing the continuing history of racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive biologisms, or the urgency of their exposure, that has made the gravamen of so many contemporary projects of critique. At the same time, we fear \textemdash{} with installation of an automatic antibiologism as the unshifting tenet of `theory' \textemdash{} the loss of conceptual access to an entire thought-realm. (Sedgwick and Frank, 1995: 15), I was left wondering what danger had been averted by the exclusion of biology. What does the nominative `biological or anatomical body' actually refer to? And what secures the separation of its inadmissible matter from the proper purview of Irigaray's textual interventions? When I asked a question to this effect it was met with a certain nervous comprehension. Deciding, perhaps, that I must still be immersed in a precritical understanding of the body, the speaker dismissed me with a revealing theatrical gesture. As if to emphasize the sheer absurdity of my question she pinched herself and commented `Well I don't mean this body'. And so it seemed with a gesture so matter of fact that it required no further comment, the fact of (the) matter was both decided and dispatched. (Kirby, 1997: 70), Feminism has been as deeply implicated in routinized antiessentialism as any of our critical procedures. Even though questions of `the body' have become increasingly fashionable in all manner of feminist projects (surely `the body' has become, in a very short space of time, one of our most routinized theoretical gestures), the schedule of feminism's antibiologism has been little altered. In most of these projects on `the body', the body in question is pursued in its socially, experientially, or psychically constituted forms, but rarely in its physiologically, biochemically, or microbiologically constituted form, the idea of biological construction having been rendered either unintelligible or naive. Despite an avowed interest in the body, there is a persistent distaste for biological detail. (Wilson, 1998: 14\textemdash 15), These feminist theories have usually been reluctant to engage with biological data: they retain, and encourage, the fierce antibiologism that marked the emergence of second wave feminism. (Wilson, 2004: 13), That feminist scholars are particularly prone to a `knee jerk constructivism' helps explain the reluctance of those in the humanities to engage seriously with the claims of science. (Squier, 2004: 46), This book functions primarily as a reminder to social, political, and cultural theorists, particularly those interested in feminism, antiracism and questions of the politics of globalisation, that they have forgotten a crucial dimension of research, if not necessary to, then certainly useful for more incisively formulating the concepts on which they so heavily, if implicitly rely. It is written as a remembrance of what we have forgotten \textemdash{} not just the body, but that which makes it possible and which limits its actions: the precarious, accidental, contingent, expedient, striving, dynamic status of life in a messy, complicated, resistant, brute world of materiality, a world regulated by the exigencies, the forces, of space and time. We have forgotten the nature, the ontology, of the body, the conditions under which bodies are encultured, psychologized, given identity, historical location, and agency. We have forgotten where we come from. (Grosz, 2004a: 2)},

This study is aimed at exploring the usability evaluation process of an assistive technology on the example of Face Controller (FC). To trace the evaluation process, a comparison of the FC usability evaluation between PWDs (N = 29) and persons with no disabilities (PNDs; N = 32) was performed. The present study revealed that the PWDs reported higher satisfaction and perceived usability of the FC comparing to the PNDs, whereas the effectiveness and efficiency were both lower for PWDs. This asymmetrical pattern of the results in the evaluation of the FC usability is discussed as an extension of disability paradox and can enhance the understanding of conceptualization and evaluation HCI made by PWDs.},

As appliances and computation move away from the desktop, and as designers move toward designing for emotion and social connection rather than usability and utility, we are poised to design technologies that are explicitly intimate and/or intimacy promoting. This workshop will: critically reflect on notions of intimacy; consider cultural and ethical issues in designing intimate technologies; and explore potential socio-technical design methods for intimate computing.},

The problem with these approaches to socially responsible design is that they are usually based on a given set of design methods. Such methods respond to conditions of practice that are outmoded and don't respond to the contemporary presence of the image, and it's affect on materiality and the body in design practice. This is a problem in relation to evolving ecologies where new methods are needed to tackle problems that arise because of the change. In response, this work tries to develop alternative design methods for social change, particularly by exploring the relationships between image and vital material as a key variable. Through a series of experiments the work argues for the potential of material as foundational for creating changing within a system. This proposes engagement with material, body, space \& image as a precursor to the linear and formalistic version of the design process.},

Rather than perceiving this situation as a loss of cognitive and moral self-mastery, Braidotti argues that the posthuman helps us make sense of our flexible and multiple identities. Braidotti then analyzes the escalating effects of post-anthropocentric thought, which encompass not only other species, but also the sustainability of our planet as a whole. Because contemporary market economies profit from the control and commodification of all that lives, they result in hybridization, erasing categorical distinctions between the human and other species, seeds, plants, animals and bacteria. These dislocations induced by globalized cultures and economies enable a critique of anthropocentrism, but how reliable are they as indicators of a sustainable future? 'The Posthuman' concludes by considering the implications of these shifts for the institutional practice of the humanities.},

The book takes us beyond the sustainable design field's established focus on energy and materials, to engage the underlying psychological phenomena that shape patterns of consumption and waste. In fluid and accessible writing, the author asks: why do we discard products that still work? He then moves forward to define strategies for the design of products that people want to keep for longer. Along the way we are introduced to over twenty examples of emotional durability in smart phones, shoes, chairs, clocks, teacups, toasters, boats and other material experiences. Emotionally Durable Design transcends the prevailing doom and gloom rhetoric of sustainability discourse, to pioneer a more hopeful, meaningful and resilient form of material culture. This second edition features pull-out quotes, illustrated product examples, a running glossary and comprehensive stand firsts; this book can be read cover to cover, or dipped in-and-out of. It is a daring call to arms for professional designers, educators, researchers and students from in a range of disciplines from product design to architecture; framing an alternative genre of design that reduces the consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and things"--Page 4 de la couverture.},

This is not necessarily the result of poor design of the technology, but rather a failure to account for other factors or determinants. This issue can be successfully addressed by employing the human activity assistive technology (HAAT) model when considering potential solutions for clients. The model conceptualizes the consumer, their activities, environment, and assistive technology as an integrated system in which changing one element affects all other elements in the system. The model can be applied in the design, selection, and evaluation of technology for use by an individual, or as a conceptual model for exploring the influence of assistive technology on participation in daily activities. In this chapter, examples and explanations are given for both ``successful'' and ``failed'' technologies with specific reference to the HAAT model.},

Design justice focuses on the ways that design reproduces, is reproduced by, and/or challenges the matrix of domination (white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, capitalism, and settler colonialism). Design justice is also a growing social movement that aims to ensure a more equitable distribution of design's benefits and burdens; fair and meaningful participation in design decisions; and recognition of community based design traditions, knowledge, and practices.},

Current technology allows applications to be efficiently distributed and run on mobile and handheld devices, even in cases where computational requirements are significant.

This trend, combined with the appearance of increasingly user-friendly interfaces and modes of interaction has opened a variety of new perspectives for the rehabilitation and training of users with visual impairments. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of these developments based on recent advances in basic research and application development. Using this overview as a foundation, an agenda is outlined for future research in mobile interaction design with respect to users with special needs, as well as ultimately in relation to sensor-bridging applications in general.},

Drawing on a survey of eighty families in Chicago who were interviewed on the subject of their feelings about common household objects, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Eugene Rochberg-Halton provide a unique perspective on materialism, American culture, and the self. They begin by reviewing what social scientists and philosophers have said about the transactions between people and things. In the model of 'personhood' that the authors develop, goal-directed action and the cultivation of meaning through signs assume central importance. They then relate theoretical issues to the results of their survey. An important finding is the distinction between objects valued for action and those valued for contemplation. The authors compare families who have warm emotional attachments to their homes with those in which a common set of positive meanings is lacking, and interpret the different patterns of involvement. They then trace the cultivation of meaning in case studies of four families. Finally, the authors address what they describe as the current crisis of environmental and material exploitation, and suggest that human capacities for the creation and redirection of meaning offer the only hope for survival. A wide range of scholars - urban and family sociologists, clinical, developmental and environmental psychologists, cultural anthropologists and philosophers, and many general readers - will find this book stimulating and compelling." http://www.loc.gov/catdir/description/cam022/81001443.html.},

For example, conversational systems often use female voices in subservient roles. They also exclude marginalized groups, such as non-binary individuals, altogether. Speech recognition systems also have significant gender, race and dialectal biases [14, 15, 19]. Instead, there is an opportunity for these systems to help change gender norms and promote inclusion and diversity as we continue to struggle with gender equality [10], and progress towards LGBTQ+ rights across the globe [13]. However, prior research claims that users strongly dislike voices without clear gender markers or misalignments between a voice and personality [12]. This calls for additional research to understand how voice assistants may be designed to not perpetuate gender bias while promoting user adoption.},

These ties can reflect the ways in which we as humans use objects to characterise, communicate and develop our sense of self. This paper outlines our approach to applying product attachment theory to design practices. We created six artefacts that were inspired by interviews conducted with three individuals who discussed details of their life stories. We then evaluated the associations that came to mind for our participants when interacting with these newly designed artefacts to determine whether these links brought meaning to them. Our findings highlight the potential of design to bring emotional value to products by embodying significant aspects of a person's self-identity. To do so, designers must consider both the importance and authenticity of the associations formed between an object and an individual.},

Academic background seems to not have any influence. The aesthetics of assistive devices was observed as an important factor that influences the adoption or abandonment of the device.Conclusion: Device without negative symbolism but with modern aesthetics (smart glasses) were positively accepted by the participants than the device with traditional aesthetics and symbolisms of visual impairment (white cane). Designers should, therefore, consider aesthetics in addition to functionality in order to avoid the perceived stigma, thereby reducing the chances of device abandonment.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONUnderstanding the factors that influence the perceived stigma associated with assistive technology can help designers and developers to reduce assistive technology abandonment and perceived stigma.Designers need to consider both functionality and aesthetics.

Responses from participants showed that users were more cautious of transmitting private than nonprivate information. This effect of type of information was amplified in the social context of public locations and when using conspicuous methods of information input such as the VAPA. Participants also preferred using the VAPA in private locations and showed no preference of location for keyboard entries. Correlations between likelihood of usage of VAPA and the social acceptability ratings were positive and predicted similar patterns of smartphone usage.}

The prototype was developed together with recapp IT (https://recapp.ch\hspace{0pt}), who provided their Swiss German speech recognition technology. Voice assistants are gaining importance as future human-computer interfaces in our lives. However, so far, there was no broad adoption in Switzerland. We believe that a significant reason for this is how Swiss German speakers have to interact with these voice assistants. None of today's assistants speaks or understands the various dialects in Switzerland, thus making communicating with them feel unnatural and uncanny. In this project, we propose to build a new text-to-speech model for different Swiss German dialects. Such a synthesis model can be applied in many different contexts beyond voice assistants such as podcasts, article narration, and automatic radio show generation. This work's final outcome will be a model that translates High German text to Swiss German speech. Please note that this is a work in progress.}

  abstract = {Since at least the mid-1980s, design has been dominated by a human-centered and user-centered paradigm. Currently, the implications of technological and environmental transformations are challenging designers to focus on complex socio-technical systems. This article traces emergent discussions around posthumanism from across a range of disciplines and perspectives, and considers examples from emerging design practices that emphasize the interrelations between human and nonhuman actors. Specifically, this article reviews literature from actor-network theory (ANT), feminist new materialism, object-oriented ontology, non-representational theory, and transhumanism to inform the development of new methodologies and practices in the field of design. Finally, this article presents critiques of posthumanism from critical race theory and decolonial theory to consider how emergent design perspectives might better support values such as equality and justice for humans and nonhumans that have been traditionally ignored in design processes.},

  abstract = {ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The thesis follows my practice based research process as a visual communication designer concerned with visualising deep ecological thought. Throughout this thesis, I apply Timothy Morton's dark ecology theory that argues that an awareness of negativity and tragic melancholy is  necessary in order to understand our current ecological climate. This mood is integral to closing the gap between internal human involvement and the supposed external environment. The first section Animism - from deep roots to dark loops is devoted to a theoretical unpacking of animism  as a dark contested theory in relation to the darkness of our present ecology in crisis.  In the second section, Aesthetic animism, I discuss my own creative practice as an expression of ecological thought supported by an animist mode of perceiving. Animism is unpacked as an outsider philosophy joins forces with working with waste matter in my art-design practice, more specifically the excrement of the ocean. This text incorporates a synergy between knowledge and visuality, text and designed objects as a means of practicing ecological literacy.  In order to aid the ecology in crisis this text argues for a renewed, modest, prophetic kinship with our environment, that extends a hand towards non-human agents including the earth  within a practice based research process in the realm of visual arts.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms are widely used throughout our economy in making decisions that have far-reaching impacts on employment, education, access to credit, and other areas. Initially considered neutral and fair, ML algorithms have recently been found increasingly biased, creating and perpetuating structural inequalities in society. With the rising concerns about algorithmic bias, a growing body of literature attempts to understand and resolve the issue of algorithmic bias. In this tutorial, we discuss five important aspects of algorithmic bias. We start with its definition and the notions of fairness policy makers, practitioners, and academic researchers have used and proposed. Next, we note the challenges in identifying and detecting algorithmic bias given the observed decision outcome, and we describe methods for bias detection. We then explain the potential sources of algorithmic bias and review several bias-correction methods. Finally, we discuss how agents' strategic behavior may lead to biased societal outcomes, even when the algorithm itself is unbiased. We conclude by discussing open questions and future research directions.},

We argue, in contrast, that it is a resource for design that can be used to encourage close personal engagement with systems. We illustrate this with examples from contemporary arts and design practice, and distinguish three broad classes of ambiguity according to where uncertainty is located in the interpretative relationship linking person and artefact. Ambiguity of information finds its source in the artefact itself, ambiguity of context in the sociocultural discourses that are used to interpret it, and ambiguity of relationship in the interpretative and evaluative stance of the individual. For each of these categories, we describe tactics for emphasising ambiguity that may help designers and other practitioners understand and craft its use.},

  editor = {Grusin, Richard},

  publisher = {{University of Minnesota Press}},
  abstract = {Edited by Richard Grusin of the Center for 21st Century Studies, this is the first book to name and characterize-and therefore consolidate-a wide array of current critical, theoretical, and philosophical approaches to the humanities and social sciences under the concept of the nonhuman turn. Each of these approaches is engaged in decentering the human in favor of a concern for the nonhuman, understood by contributors in a variety of ways-in terms of animals, affectivity, bodies, materiality, technologies, and organic and geophysical systems.  The nonhuman turn in twenty-first-century studies can be traced to multiple intellectual and theoretical developments from the last decades of the twentieth century: actor-network theory, affect theory, animal studies, assemblage theory, cognitive sciences, new materialism, new media theory, speculative realism, and systems theory. Such varied analytical and theoretical formations obviously diverge and disagree in many of their assumptions, objects, and methodologies. However, they all take up aspects of the nonhuman as critical to the future of twenty-first-century studies in the arts, humanities, and social sciences.  Unlike the posthuman turn, the nonhuman turn does not make a claim about teleology or progress in which we begin with the human and see a transformation from the human to the posthuman. Rather, the nonhuman turn insists (paraphrasing Bruno Latour) that "we have never been human," that the human has always coevolved, coexisted, or collaborated with the nonhuman-and that the human is identified precisely by this indistinction from the nonhuman.

  abstract = {``All too often,'' wrote disabled architect Ronald Mace, ``designers don't take the needs of disabled and elderly people into account.'' Building Access investigates twentieth-century strategies for designing the world with disability in mind. Commonly understood in terms of curb cuts, automatic doors, Braille signs, and flexible kitchens, Universal Design purported to create a built environment for everyone, not only the average citizen. But who counts as ``everyone,'' Aimi Hamraie asks, and how can designers know? Blending technoscience studies and design history with critical disability, race, and feminist theories, Building Access interrogates the historical, cultural, and theoretical contexts for these questions, offering a groundbreaking critical history of Universal Design. Hamraie reveals that the twentieth-century shift from ``design for the average'' to ``design for all'' took place through liberal political, economic, and scientific structures concerned with defining the disabled user and designing in its name. Tracing the co-evolution of accessible design for disabled veterans, a radical disability maker movement, disability rights law, and strategies for diversifying the architecture profession, Hamraie shows that Universal Design was not just an approach to creating new products or spaces, but also a sustained, understated activist movement challenging dominant understandings of disability in architecture, medicine, and society. Illustrated with a wealth of rare archival materials, Building Accessbrings together scientific, social, and political histories in what is not only the pioneering critical account of Universal Design but also a deep engagement with the politics of knowing, making, and belonging in twentieth-century United States. \textcopyright{} 2017 by the Regents of the University of Minnesota.

  abstract = {This study presents a novel method for evaluating the scientific research papers in the field of assistive technologies pertaining to different impairment conditions. The objectives are to understand the technologies used for addressing the needs of PWD by identifying relevant criteria for the assessment, explore the implications of these technologies in their lives and identify the gaps among certain technologies in assisting PWD. In this article, we reviewed around 40 research scientific papers in relation to the technologies used to assist PWD in their daily activities. A novel quantitative assessment methodology based on Multi-weighted Scoring Model (MWSM) has been developed. It is based on the judgement of clinical experts according to thirteen well-defined criteria. The proposed method is useful because it assesses the scientific studies related to PWD qualitatively according to efficient research coverage, as well as quantitatively in order to have good comparative judgment. Moreover, this method recognizes the research gap or areas which need further investigation and identifies the research papers that have good coverage of the respective criteria.Implications for RehabilitationHuman computer interface (HCI) solutions are critical for addressing the main issues facing people with disabilities (PWD) in their life.Assessment of scientific research papers according to well-defined criteria that address PWD needs would assist in verifying their suitability for PWDs.Novel quantitative assessment methodology is used for assessing these research papers using judgment of experienced researchers according to 13 well-defined criteria that have been weighted according to relevancy to different impairment groups.Identifying research papers that have good coverage of defined criteria and knowing the research area that needs further investigation by researchers and developers, would ultimately address the rehabilitation needs for PWD.},

  abstract = {Africa is currently the fastest-urbanizing continent in the world. As part of this rapid growth, New Towns are increasingly employed by private developers as a means of providing well-serviced urban environments to middle- and upper-income groups. These comprehensively-planned New Towns are often seen in contrast to the perceived `chaos' and `congestion' of large African cities. As a result, two urban forms, the highly controlled New Towns and the unregulated settlements at their edges, engage in complex social and economic exchanges, but remain spatially segregated and socially exclusive. Current research points to the need for an alternative approach to top-down New Town planning in Africa. Participatory workshops are one alternative that can offer planners access to local knowledge that is otherwise difficult to access. This paper explores the potential of short-term reflective, design, and serious gaming workshops by reflecting on the experiences of the authors in four recent workshops. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of these workshops as useful tools to increase inclusivity in African New Towns by bringing together stakeholders with competing agendas and supporting open discussion, negotiation, and informed decision-making. The paper concludes that participation from stakeholder groups that would normally be marginalized from the planning process (such as current residents, temporary users, and residents of adjacent unregulated communities), can offer new insights to planning bodies and inform more inclusive New Towns across the continent.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study assessed a new technology system to help six participants with intellectual and visual disabilities manage leisure engagement and communication with distant partners in an independent manner.Methods A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across participants was used to assess the effects of the new technology system. This included a Samsung Galaxy J4 Plus smartphone with Android 9.0 operating system, mini voice recording devices, and a Bluetooth speaker. The smartphone was provided with a Google account and Internet connection. The participants could activate the smartphone's Google Assistant and thus access leisure events, start telephone calls or send messages by triggering mini voice recording devices. Each device, when triggered, uttered a specific verbal request (i.e., a request for a leisure option or for a communication partner to call or to reach by messages). Messages received from those partners were read automatically by the smartphone.Results During baseline (when the voice recording devices were not available), the participants did not manage to activate the smartphone's Google Assistant and thus did not access leisure events and did not make telephone calls or send messages independently. During the post-intervention phase (when the voice recording devices were available), all participants accessed leisure events and made telephone calls or sent and received messages independently, remaining positively engaged throughout the 10-min sessions. Staff rated the new technology system positively.Conclusion The new technology system may be a useful resource to help people like the participants of this study access basic leisure and communication independently.Implications for rehabilitationA technology system relying on commercial devices may be practical and acceptable in daily programs for persons with intellectual and other disabilities.Such system may be used for supporting the persons' independent leisure engagement and communication with distant partners.A system may be accessible to persons with significant disabilities if the responses needed to operate it are simple.Simple hand-pressure responses may be sufficient to operate a system that relies on the input of mini voice recording devices},

This chapter is a meditation on the complex interaction between design and animism. First, an exploration of what is commonly known as animism is required, for the difference between animism and post-animism has only little to do with the belief in the life of things, and actually, is a severely outdated construct of the 19th century. Second, the current discussion on animistic epistemologies is reviewed in order to further clarify the term and to enable a more inclusive and relational discourse for product design theory. Third, some evolutionary considerations are dedicated to the question of cognitive epistemologies in general and whether or not humans are innately animistic, specifically. Finally, purposeful animism \textendash{} the idea of designing animistic relationships between objects and users of objects \textendash{} is explored. Here emotional durability as a design direction is addressed since it seeks to create stronger emotionality and enduring interaction with things, which in turn can lead to a more sustainable use of resources. Things regarded as housing a spirit \textendash{} it is assumed here \textendash{} are more likely to be revered and protected.},

The rate at which technology is being created that could be used to help people with disabilities is staggering. However, disturbingly little of that technology is being harnessed to provide actual benefit to the disabled community because the adaptation of that technology is viewed as too customized or the market size too small to justify commercialization.

  abstract = {Increased awareness, interest and use of assistive technology (AT) presents substantial opportunities for many citizens to become, or continue being, meaningful participants in society. However, there is a significant shortfall between the need for and provision of AT, and this is patterned by a range of social, demographic and structural factors. To seize the opportunity that assistive technology offers, regional, national and sub-national assistive technology policies are urgently required. This paper was developed for and through discussion at the Global Research, Innovation and Education on Assistive Technology (GREAT) Summit; organized under the auspices of the World Health Organization's Global Collaboration on Assistive Technology (GATE) program. It outlines some of the key principles that AT polices should address and recognizes that AT policy should be tailored to the realities of the contexts and resources available. AT policy should be developed as a part of the evolution of related policy across a number of different sectors and should have clear and direct links to AT as mediators and moderators for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The consultation process, development and implementation of policy should be fully inclusive of AT users, and their representative organizations, be across the lifespan, and imbued with a strong systems-thinking ethos. Six barriers are identified which funnel and diminish access to AT and are addressed systematically within this paper. We illustrate an example of good practice through a case study of AT services in Norway, and we note the challenges experienced in less well-resourced settings. A number of economic factors relating to AT and economic arguments for promoting AT use are also discussed. To address policy-development the importance of active citizenship and advocacy, the need to find mechanisms to scale up good community practices to a higher level, and the importance of political engagement for the policy process, are highlighted. Policy should be evidence-informed and allowed for evidence-making; however, it is important to account for other factors within the given context in order for policy to be practical, authentic and actionable.Implications for RehabilitationThe development of policy in the area of asssitive technology is important to provide an overarching vision and outline resourcing priorities.This paper identifies some of the key themes that should be addressed when developing or revising assistive technology policy.Each country should establish a National Assistive Technology policy and develop a theory of change for its implementation.},

  abstract = {This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human\textendash machine interaction as a milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a practical\textendash theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the human and the nonhuman. Using a `research through making' approach, the article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an openended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital interaction, and to engender creative human\textendash nonhuman relationships within a given digital milieu.},

  abstract = {Background: Voice assistants allow users to control appliances and functions of a smart home by simply uttering a few words. Such systems hold the potential to significantly help users with motor and cognitive disabilities who currently depend on their caregiver even for basic needs (eg, opening a door). The research on voice assistants is mainly dedicated to able-bodied users, and studies evaluating the accessibility of such systems are still sparse and fail to account for the participants' actual motor, linguistic, and cognitive abilities. Objective: The aim of this work is to investigate whether cognitive and/or linguistic functions could predict user performance in operating an off-the-shelf voice assistant (Google Home). Methods: A group of users with disabilities (n=16) was invited to a living laboratory and asked to interact with the system. Besides collecting data on their performance and experience with the system, their cognitive and linguistic skills were assessed using standardized inventories. The identification of predictors (cognitive and/or linguistic) capable of accounting for an efficient interaction with the voice assistant was investigated by performing multiple linear regression models. The best model was identified by adopting a selection strategy based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results: For users with disabilities, the effectiveness of interacting with a voice assistant is predicted by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Robertson Dysarthria Profile (specifically, the ability to repeat sentences), as the best model shows (AIC=130.11). Conclusions: Users with motor, linguistic, and cognitive impairments can effectively interact with voice assistants, given specific levels of residual cognitive and linguistic skills. More specifically, our paper advances practical indicators to predict the level of accessibility of speech-based interactive systems. Finally, accessibility design guidelines are introduced based on the performance results observed in users with disabilities.},

We examine loyalty and experimentation with screen readers and find that the main drivers of adoption for early users differ significantly from the factors that drive continued use by advanced users. We discuss the factor that emerges as one of the strongest stated drivers of early adoption, text-to-speech ``voice'' quality, particularly a ``human-sounding voice'' as one of the key features differentiating free/open source products from more expensive proprietary products. While the initial preferences are driven by voice quality, application support becomes more important over time as users speed up their sound settings and become more comfortable with the resultant non-human-sounding speech. We discuss these findings from two theoretical perspectives\textemdash first, through the application of the economics of behavior switching, and second, vis-\`a-vis novice and expert approaches toward new product adoption. We argue that these findings further our understanding of initial user comfort related to assistive technology adoption, and the impact of early technology choices on long-term technology switching behavior.},

  abstract = {With the widespread use of AI systems and applications in our everyday lives, it is important to take fairness issues into consideration while designing and engineering these types of systems. Such systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that the decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. We have recently seen work in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning that addresses such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming aware of the biases that these applications can contain and have attempted to address them. In this survey we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined in order to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and how they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.},

  abstract = {More than 40 years ago, Masahiro Mori, a robotics professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, wrote an essay [1] on how he envisioned people's reactions to robots that looked and acted almost like a human. In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available. The following is the first publication of an English translation that has been authorized and reviewed by Mori. (See ``Turning Point'' in this issue for an interview with Mori.).},

The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

A literature review illustrated that workshops are discussed according to three different perspectives: workshops as a means, workshops as practice, and workshops as a research methodology. Focusing primarily on the latter, this paper presents five studies on upper secondary and higher education teachers' professional development and on teaching and learning through video conferencing. Through analysis and discussion of these studies' findings, we argue that workshops provide a platform that can aid researchers in identifying and exploring relevant factors in a given domain by providing means for understanding complex work and knowledge processes that are supported by technology (for example, e-learning). The approach supports identifying factors that are not obvious to either the participants or the researchers prior to commencing the workshop process. This paper also discusses the facilitator's different clinical and ethnographic roles and highlights the risks and ethical issues involved during both the workshop process and the workshop data analysis. As such, these collaborative and immersive aspects frame workshops as a research approach that has the potential to advance meaning negotiation between researchers and participants.},

These devices embody intelligent software agents that support users in their everyday life through easy and intuitive conversational interactions. While their use in everyday activities is largely unexplored, the proliferation in home use presents a valuable opportunity to add to understanding around the use of in-home digital personal assistants. In this paper, we investigate their home use in a broad context to learn more about people's experiences, attitudes, interactions and expectations with these devices contributing new insights to current knowledge around this use. Applying the digital ethnography method, we collected 3542 reviews and comments about Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple HomePod on Amazon, eBay, and Reddit. Six main themes and 29 categories were derived through filtering, thematic analysis and affinity diagramming. These findings constitute a conceptual framework characterising the current landscape of home use of digital personal assistants. Additionally, we identify and discuss unique issues discovered around the invisible interface, interactive freedom, and creative appropriation. We use our findings to propose implications for interaction design of DPAs for home use.},

While stigma has been known to be associated with presence of disability for many years, relationship between stigma and AT usage, particularly when working with families across cultures, has only just begun to be examined. Issues confronted by AT decision-making teams related to stigma include family expectations of AT, visibility resulting from use of AT in public settings, and perceptions that children will not attain important developmental skills if they become reliant on devices. While numerous approaches for AT decision-making have been implemented in the field, absence of validity and reliability data related to such approaches emphasizes importance of understanding potential influences of stigma associated with AT use. Specific areas that can contribute to stigmatization include (a) device aesthetics/cosmesis, (b) gender and age appropriateness, (c) social acceptability, (d) sublimation and professional deference, (e) teachers and acceptance of disability, and (f) universal design principles. Importance of future research that explores stigma and government policy and impact on AT decision-making is noted.},

  abstract = {Purpose of the paper: The increasing consumer adoption of voice-based artificial intelligence technologies is starting to catch the attention of researchers. This study fits into the nascent marketing literature on user perceptions of interactions with voice assistants (VAs) by exploring perceived VA anthropomorphism and benefits. We also seek to identify millennial clusters based on perceptual differences. Methodology: Quantitative exploratory research was conducted based on questionnaires (N=337) administered to millennials. The data were analysed through exploratory factor analysis. Subsequently, to identify clusters, we performed K-means cluster analysis. Findings: The EFA indicated a four-factor solution: ``utilitarian and hedonic benefits'', ``symbolic benefits'', ``human-like voice'' and ``human-like presence''. The K-means cluster analysis identified three clusters: ``useful and pleasant'', ``human'' and ``status symbol''. Research limits: This paper is not exempt from limitations, especially those related to the exploratory nature of the analysis techniques adopted. Practical implications: Indicating the main perceptual dimensions of VA anthropomorphism and the benefits associated with user-VA interaction, our results provide marketers with important strategic implications for designing the VA interaction experience. The cluster analysis offers companies the possibility of selecting a target and addressing it by creating a specific value proposition. Originality of the paper: This study contributes to the existing partial and fragmented knowledge by offering an overall integrated interpretation of consumer perceptions related to VA interactions. Our findings are the first to jointly reveal user perceptions of the human voice and of the VA as a human interlocutor. Moreover, we contribute to the literature on anthropomorphism by conceptualising the human-like voice construct.},

We discuss the tangle of practical and nonfunctional needs that characterize the experience of users at home in an ampler way, aiming at effective wellbeing. To synthesize the results of ethnography, we introduce the concept of resilience in domestic environment arguing that, in the design of solutions for home automation, we must consider home as a dynamic place, apt to support the continuous change of needs and lifestyles of users.},

For relationships to work it is essential for trust to be established. Although the capabilities of VAs offer retailers and consumers enhanced opportunities, building trust with machines is inherently challenging. In this paper, we propose integrating Human\textendash Computer Interaction Theories and Para-Social Relationship Theory to develop insight into how trust and attitudes toward VAs are established. By adopting a mixed-method approach, first, we quantitatively examine the proposed model using Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modeling on 466 respondents; based on the findings of this study, a second qualitative study is employed to reveal four main themes. Findings show that while functional elements drive users' attitude toward using VAs, the social attributes, being social presence and social cognition, are the unique antecedents for developing trust. Additionally, the research illustrates a peculiar dynamic between privacy and trust and it shows how users distinguish two different sources of trustworthiness in their interactions with VAs, identifying the brand producers as the data collector. Taken together, these results reinforce the idea that individuals interact with VAs treating them as social entities and employing human social rules, thus supporting the adoption of a para-social perspective.},

Two concepts, stigma and liminality (existing in a state of transition), are used to frame users' perceptions of the assistive technology they use, as generated through research projects investigating aspects of assistive technology use. Implications of the meaning of AT to the design and selection process are described. Assistive technology that is seen as a tool, as just another way of achieving a desired activity is much more likely to be assimilated into the user's daily life. Technology perceived in this manner enables people to share activities with others and augment their personal abilities. Alternately, technology can be seen as a visible sign of disability, reinforcing stigma associated with a disability and the perception of the AT user as existing somewhere between health and illness. Individuals with this view of technology may avoid or resist use of technology, resulting in avoidance of meaningful activities and both social and physical isolation. These findings support the conclusion that technology is not neutral. Inclusion of users in both the design and selection process and understanding the meaning that AT use holds are integral to the development of assistive technology that achieves the desired outcome of enabling participation in daily life.},

The first, broader study is a content analysis of 346 Amazon Echo reviews that include users with disabilities, while the second study more specifically focuses on users with visual impairments, through interviews with 16 current users of home-based IPAs. Findings show that, although some accessibility challenges exist, users with a range of disabilities are using the Amazon Echo, including for unexpected cases such as speech therapy and support for caregivers. Richer voice-based applications and solutions to support discoverability would be particularly useful to users with visual impairments.

  abstract = {How posthumanist design enables a world in which humans share center stage with nonhumans, with whom we are entangled.                 Over the past forty years, designers have privileged human values such that human-centered design is seen as progressive. Yet because all that is not human has been depleted, made extinct, or put to human use, today's design contributes to the existential threat of climate change and the ongoing extinctions of other species. In Things We Could Design, Ron Wakkary argues that human-centered design is not the answer to our problems but is itself part of the problem. Drawing on philosophy, design theory, and numerous design works, he shows the way to a relational and expansive design based on humility and cohabitation. Wakkary says that design can no longer ignore its exploitation of nonhuman species and the materials we mine for and reduce to human use. Posthumanism, he argues, enables a rethinking of design that displaces the human at the center of thought and action. Weaving together posthumanist philosophies with design, he describes what he calls things\textemdash nonhumans made by designers\textemdash and calls for a commitment to design with more than human participation. Wakkary also focuses on design as ``nomadic practices''\textemdash a multiplicity of intentionalities and situated knowledges that shows design to be expansive and pluralistic. He calls his overall approach ``designing-with'': the practice of design in a world in which humans share center stage with nonhumans, and in which we are bound together materially, ethically, and existentially.},

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of computer usage on the quality of life of computer-based assistive device users, and to evaluate their capacity to carry out computer-based tasks.                                         Methods               The study was conducted between the years 2013 and 2015. Questionnaires were provided to 96 randomly sampled individuals with visual impairments. These questionnaires were designed to collect information about the quality of life, types and frequency of computer use, satisfaction with the assistive devices, and the effects of computer-based assistive device usage on the participants' lives. In addition, the study evaluated participants' performance in tasks such as e-mail use, Internet surfing, and the use of Microsoft Word; participants performed these tasks on their personal computers. The research sample accounts for about 10\% of visually impaired persons in Israel.                                         Results               Findings suggest that participants use computer-based assistive devices frequently (four hours a day on average), primarily for leisure (three hours on average). Participants also report high satisfaction with their devices (mean of 3.98 out of the maximum score of 5.00) and indicate that the devices have improved their quality of life (mean 3.67 out of 5.00) and leisure activities (mean 3.68 out of 5.00). Participants display high levels of task performance, especially in the use of Microsoft Word software (mean of 3.47 out of 5.00), and e-mail usage (mean of 3.81 out of 5.00).                                         Discussion               The findings suggest that most participants use computer-based assistive devices daily and report a positive influence from them on their quality of life and activity.

Nepal is one example of a country with several coinciding challenges: some claim having a high rate of blindness in the general population, a low-GDP-per capita and some studies claim it has a low literacy rate, especially in rural areas. Without appropriate assistive technology, some disabled youth may not get full access to education.Methods To gain insight into assistive technology use in rural Nepal, five blind teenagers in a mixed secondary school with disabled and non-disabled students in rural Nepal were interviewed about their daily smartphone use.Results The results show that all the participants used screen readers on donated smartphones. None of the participants had received formal training in using smartphone screen readers and therefore lacked knowledge about basic and essential operational aspects of the devices as well as misguided expectations about the technology.Conclusions One implication of the findings is that smartphone accessibility features training material needs to be made easily available to schools and all disabled youth worldwide, as smartphones are increasingly becoming available in low-income remote regions with low literacy rates. The built-in accessibility features of smartphones promise disabled youth a non-stigmatizing platform for social participation and access to the information society.Implications for RehabilitationThe built-in accessibility features of smartphones provide disabled youth a non-stigmatizing practical platform for social participation and access to education.Training material on how to use smartphone accessibility features needs to be made easily available to schools and all disabled youth worldwide.},

The present review aims to highlight accessible features and apps along with usages, including educational, and access to smartphones as assistive technology for visual impairment and blindness. It also includes advantages and challenges faced by users, and usability testing by app developers. There have been significant recent developments in mobile technology that incorporate computer technology relating to electronic information, communication, and touch-screen accessibility. Such advances in technology are transforming the use of smartphones from a traditional visual interface to a truly visual free interaction using alternative body senses, such as haptic, gesture, and so on. There are many built-in accessible features and third-party accessible applications that enable people with visual impairment to perform daily activities, independent functioning, movement, social inclusion and participation, education, etc. They are universally designed, so they are unlikely to induce social stigma or negative reactions from peers or public. Healthcare practitioners, not limiting to eye care, and caregivers, family members, teachers, or special educators should be informed about the potential uses and benefits of smartphones for visually impaired in developing nations. Evidence shows that most of the users train by themselves. Enhancing the awareness along with training for teachers and caregivers would be helpful to improve access and skills among users with visual disabilities. Developers are continuously producing more innovative applications for visual impairment, which indicates the need for having a training guideline on the use of smartphones.},

But as these agents have grown more realistic, concerns have been raised over how their social nature might unconsciously shape our interactions with them. Through a survey of 500 voice assistant users, we explore whether users' relationships with their voice assistants can be quantified using the same metrics as social, interpersonal relationships; as well as if this correlates with how much they trust their devices and the extent to which they anthropomorphise them. Using Knapp's staircase model of human relationships, we find that not only can human-device interactions be modelled in this way, but also that relationship development with voice assistants correlates with increased trust and anthropomorphism.},

As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research.},

This essay examines two sources that appear to inform current understandings of the ethics of assistive technology: medical ethics and engineering ethics. From medical ethics comes the notion that assistive technology should aim to restore its users to normal functioning, making them like new. Engineering ethics, on the other hand, recommends enhancing users' functionality, even if functioning is not achieved in a species typical way. From this engineering perspective, it is permissible and even desirable for assistive technology to make its users function even better than new. Thus enhancing functionality is a central value in assistive technology. Professionals in the field have the ability, and the responsibility as well, to address and counter societal suspicion of artificially enhanced functioning achieved through technology. Consequently, assistive technology professionals should fight against discrimination that excludes people with disabilities, whose functioning depends on prostheses and other products of technology, from the mainstream of social life.},

  abstract = {Universal design is the design of buildings, products or environments to make them accessible to all people, regardless of age, disability or other factors. The term "universal design" was coined by the architect Ronald Mace to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life. However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of Designing for the Disabled (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb \textendash{} now a standard feature of the built environment. Universal design emerged from slightly earlier barrier-free concepts, the broader accessibility movement, and adaptive and assistive technology and also seeks to blend aesthetics into these core considerations. As life expectancy rises and modern medicine increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology, instruction, services, and other products and environments. Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps, essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example.  Color-contrast dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another.  There are also cabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's public transit systems, low-floor buses that "kneel" (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with ramps rather than on-board lifts.},

Yet two decades of daily cultural integration with interfaces have demonstrated that virtuality is only one of many aspects of our interactive experience with digital devices. A need therefore exists for new concepts more apt to address the philosophical complexity of the digital phenomenon and the signi cance of our interactions with calculated matter as they are true existential experiences of phenomenological signi cance. In this chapter I explain why I have suggested introducing the phenomenological concept of ontophany (manifestation of being). In close relationship with a comprehensive and broadened understanding of Bachelard's notion of ``phenomenotechnique,'' I examine the hitherto unidenti ed technicality of this manifestation process. Prior to their existence as tools in uses, technologies are rst the perceptual structure of our existence; they are the ``devices'' or the invisible matrixes, produced by culture and history, into which our potential experience-ofthe-world is cast. Not only do the following theoretical propositions seek to contribute, philosophically, to Internet Studies and to a better understanding the Digital Age, they also hope to give rise to a broader deliberation on technology and perception, as they relate to an approach I would characterize as a historical phenomenology of technology.},

  abstract = {This paper illuminates how gendered stereotypes can be leveraged to assuage anxieties surrounding artificially intelligent virtual assistants (AI VA). In particular, the analysis shows that these AI objects routinely traffic in normative gender roles of the feminine as caretaker, mother, and wife in order to obfuscate modes of surveillance, and mediate the relationship users and potential users have with late-capitalist market logics in the platform economy. Mobilizing essentialist feminine personas characterized in this paper as ``digital domesticity,'' artificially intelligent objects orient users to engage productively with surveillance capitalism as natural. To illustrate this relationship between femininity and surveillance, this paper focuses on two case studies of AI VA. The essay turns to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa as emblematic of AI VA that perform a stereotypically feminine persona that invites users to participate in increasingly intimate forms of data exchange that in turn contribute to surveillance capitalism. The study of AI VA, like Siri and Alexa, demonstrates the significant rhetorical capacities of the feminine persona as they are applied to objects with weak (that is, limited) artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {Cognitive design constitutes a cognitively-informed engineering method for developing assistive technologies. The approach is challenging in that it involves matching key cognitive principles for a given problem domain to engineering principles, and that an independent validation procedure is required for the cognitive component. In addition, we argue for a broad set of evaluation criteria and adapt a participatory design framework, one that involves the client population throughout the design process. After laying out the main precepts of the approach, we illustrate these via a particular design process, seeking to provide situational awareness and navigational assistance to persons who are blind. The problem domain is described in some detail. A solution is then presented that involves matching the need for configural knowledge about the person's surroundings with a hierarchical organisation in the spatial database so that information may be presented to the user at different levels of detail. The process involved to implement this solution is then outlined, and appropriate validation experiments described. It is noted that the cognitive design process as presented here is in use now in a number of initiatives, and that it involves a high degree of collaboration between experts from different disciplines.},

  abstract = {Background: A voice assistant (VA) is inanimate audio-interfaced software augmented with artificial intelligence, capable of 2-way dialogue, and increasingly used to access health care advice. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common perinatal mood disorder with an annual estimated cost of \$14.2 billion. Only a small percentage of PPD patients seek care due to lack of screening and insufficient knowledge of the disease, and this is, therefore, a prime candidate for a VA-based digital health intervention. Objective: In order to understand the capability of VAs, our aim was to assess VA responses to PPD questions in terms of accuracy, verbal response, and clinically appropriate advice given. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined four VAs (Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana) installed on two mobile devices in early 2020. We posed 14 questions to each VA that were retrieved from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) patient-focused Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on PPD. We scored the VA responses according to accuracy of speech recognition, presence of a verbal response, and clinically appropriate advice in accordance with ACOG FAQ, which were assessed by two board-certified physicians. Results: Accurate recognition of the query ranged from 79\% to 100\%. Verbal response ranged from 36\% to 79\%. If no verbal response was given, queries were treated like a web search between 33\% and 89\% of the time. Clinically appropriate advice given by VA ranged from 14\% to 29\%. We compared the category proportions using the Fisher exact test. No single VA statistically outperformed other VAs in the three performance categories. Additional observations showed that two VAs (Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana) included advertisements in their responses. Conclusions: While the best performing VA gave clinically appropriate advice to 29\% of the PPD questions, all four VAs taken together achieved 64\% clinically appropriate advice. All four VAs performed well in accurately recognizing a PPD query, but no VA achieved even a 30\% threshold for providing clinically appropriate PPD information. Technology companies and clinical organizations should partner to improve guidance, screen patients for mental health disorders, and educate patients on potential treatment.},

  abstract = {Problems with emotional attachment to objects (i.e., object attachment) are a key component of hoarding disorder (HD) in the cognitive-behavioral model of HD. We hypothesized that excessive object attachment is an attempt to compensate for unmet relatedness needs. We tested this hypothesis in two studies by examining whether object attachment mediates the relationship between loneliness and HD using bootstrapped multiple regression analyses in a community sample (Study 1; n = 213) and an undergraduate sample of individuals with high hoarding symptoms (Study 2: n = 91). Participants in both studies completed self-report measures of loneliness, object attachment, and hoarding symptoms. Study 2 also accounted for the possible confounding effects of age and depressive symptoms. Results from both studies showed that loneliness and object attachment were positively associated with HD symptoms. Study 1 showed that object attachment mediated the relationship between loneliness and HD symptoms, and Study 2 showed a significant mediation even after accounting for age and depression. Results provide justification for further experimental and longitudinal research into loneliness as both a cause and consequence of object attachment and HD. Further investigation may be warranted into the possibility that addressing loneliness in HD might result in lower object attachment.},

Previous research has presented user research on connected toys, but little is known how to approach them from a design perspective. This paper investigates whether and how an animistic design perspective can foster a fruitful exploration of the design potentialities of connected toys. It addresses this question by analysing three design concepts of connected toys that were developed in the course of an R\&D project. These included a high-tech bracelet with digital passport, a card game with a customizable 3D-printed figurine, and a robot as a board game play mate. The results show how the design qualities of connected toys can be categorized on a spectrum ranging from a certainty-driven, problem-solving logic to an uncertainty-driven, animistic design perspective. The contribution of this study is a better understanding of how connected toys emerge in a broader ecology of children, toys, and data that all act upon each other. By embracing the uncertainty in this complex and fluid network of subjects and objects, the animistic design perspective allows to explore a broad set of design opportunities relevant in the realm of the Internet of Toys.},
