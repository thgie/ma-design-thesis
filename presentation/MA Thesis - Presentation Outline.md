# MA Thesis - Presentation Outline

max. 20 minutes

## Introduction
- introducing google assistant
- interaction with google assistant
  - ask to say hello to the audience; stop reading
  - ask to instead set a timer

## Abstract
- introduce myself; not name
- elevator pitch research project
  - "This research proposal explores the potentials of voice assistant technologies for the blind, the extent to which this technology can provide and assist access to the world, and how their design could be improved to serve the specific needs of the target demographic and avoid risky situations."
- "dense proposition, lets untangle"
- present table of contents for presentation

## voice assistants
- talk about voice assistants in general; mention siri
- Maybe present one single number, like how many households have a voice assistant
- "For most of us, voice assistants are not much more than peculiar entertaiment electronics that are best described as gadgets."
- nonetheless decided to investigate that technology
- talking about my own research on voice assistants
  - what i've done
    - classical ethnography; interviews, observation and netnography
    - expert workshop and speculation
    - prototyping
  - wanted to get a hollistic picture; interested in the ontological dimension of VAs
    - people with my background are often interested in the technical aspects, asking, what can it do and not, what will it do
    - explain ontological dimension
      - ontological designing anne-marie willis
  - what i've found;
    - thematic analysis; explain TA briefly
    - they came to stay
    - they're weird
      - despite being a gadget in most cases, treatment of VAs is quite different then, say, a toaster or a lamp; due to integration in home (hardly ever in offices) and as a natural reaction on voice communication
  - let's keep the weird part in mind, it's important later
    - maybe memorize with quote about VA as lurking alien

## assistive technologies
- introducing social relevant part
  - definition of AT
- interview with men led to look into VAs as ATs
- what are they and why is it important
- "contrary to VAs, most of us did not experience ATs yet, so why not do quick demo?"
  - demo VoiceOver on a website 
    - everything is navigated made by keyboard
- conclude with layer model
  - blind people and ATs, and VAs
    - talk about second round of interviews
    - talking about the ongoing digitalization
    - simple things can become quite complex, like reading bus schedule
      - example of weather and right clothing
- talk about the informal adoption of VAs by blind people
  - guessing about the reason why; ease of use, direct access to computing, despite the risks -> research gap
- research question

## proposed research plan
- basic consideration of ontological design
- two phases
  - after proposition of this one dude
  - ethno
  - prototyping
  - considerations for working with the community of blind people
- dry stuff
  - funding and timeline
  - output

## outro
- benefits of this research project as the thing that should stick
- why should we care (speculative outlook)
