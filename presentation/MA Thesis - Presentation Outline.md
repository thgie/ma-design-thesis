# MA Thesis - Presentation Outline

max. 20 minutes

## Introduction
- introducing google assistant
- interaction with google assistant
  - ask to say hello to the audience; stop reading
  - ask to instead set a timer
- talk about voice assistants in general; mention siri

## Abstract
- introduce myself
- elevator pitch research project
  - "This research proposal explores the potentials of voice assistant technologies for the blind, the extent to which this technology can provide and assist access to the world, and how their design could be improved to serve the specific needs of the target demographic and avoid risky situations."
- "dense proposition, lets untangle"

## On voice assistants
- "For most of us, voice assistants are not much more than peculiar entertaiment electronics that are best described as gadgets."
- talking about my own research on voice assistants
  - what i've done; interviews and ethnographics research
  - mention other activities but point to journal
    - "or you can always talk to me, if that is your thing. i'm more then happy to discuss my little corner of the world"
  - what i've found; despite being a gadget in most cases, treatment of VAs is quite different then, say, a toaster or a lamp; due to integration in home and as a natural reaction on voice communication

## voice assistants as assitive devices
- introducing social relevant part
  - "now, what to do with that knowledge?"
  - talk about pivot from ecological consideration to social relevant application
    - "like an interaction with this google assistant, things don't always turn out the way I intended them to"
    - set out to have an ecological look at consumer electronics
    - needed to realize, that this research proposal wouldn't change much if it doesn't include 
  - through one of the interviews i did in the first round i went into voice assistants as assistive devices (via VAs as therapeutic devies)
  - talk about second round of interviews
- talk about assistive technologies
  - focus on interaction with computational resources; screen readers and voice recognition
  - demo VoiceOver on a website (and compare it to how we scan visually through F or Z patterns)
- voice assistants and blind people
  - talking about the ongoing digitalization
    - "I guess none of us present here today can imagine a daily routine without using computers or smartphonesâ€¦ and I also guess you can see the importance of assistive technologies for accessing digital ressources"
  - talk about the informal adoption of VAs by blind people
    - guessing about the reason why; ease of use, direct access to computing (layer model)
  - talk about the risks associated
    - example of weather and right clothing
    - simple things can become quite complex, like reading 
    - who has the power over these things?
- research question

## proposed research plan
- basic consideration of ontological design
- two phases
  - after proposition of this one dude
  - ethno
  - prototyping
  - considerations for working with the community of blind people
- dry stuff
  - funding and timeline
  - output

## outro
- benefits of this research project as the thing that should stick
- we should we care (speculative outlook)
