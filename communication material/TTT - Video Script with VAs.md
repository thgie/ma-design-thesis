Talking to Things
Hey Siri.
Mhm?
What will the weather be like today?

It's currently partly cloudy and three degrees. Expect clear sky starting in the afternoon. Temperatures are heading down from four degrees to minus one tonight. 

This was an interaction with Apple's Siri, a voice assistant.
You have probably already heard a thing or two about voice assistants. Maybe you know Alexa, the Assistant from Amazon, or even experienced a google voice assistant device at a friends place.
For most of us, voice assistants are not much more than peculiar entertainment electronics that are best described as gadgets.


Now, imagine for a moment that you are dependend on a voice assistant. 

This research proposal explores the potentials of voice assistant technologies for the blind, the extent to which this technology can provide and assist access to the world, and how their design could be improved to serve the specific needs of blind users and avoid risky situations.
Assistive technologies help blind people having access to the world and maintain and improve their independence. They enable blind people to live following their own will and to participate in the world and are existential technologies.

Hey Google.

When is the next bus to the train station?

The best way to get to Bienne by bus is to catch three departing at two thirteen PM from Bubenbergstrasse. A two minute walk from your current location. 

It'll take about nine minutes to get there.

Thank you.

Voice assistants are increasingly adopted by blind people as assistive technologies. It seems that voice assistants do something right. That is not without problems, because traditional assistive technologiess are funded and integrated into processes of learning them. That means that blind users often carry the technological risks and financial burden in adopting voice assistants themselves.

Are voice assistants really up to the task of being of existential importance to human lives?

The project Talking to Things inquires about these differences and similarities between traditional assistive technologies for the blind and voice assistants.
What makes voice assistants attractive to blind people? Moreover, how can we ensure that these technologies are up to the task of being of existential importance? What can we learn from the design and implementation of traditional but comparative assistive technologies, like screen readers and voice recognition software?

The output of this project will be a digital publication on voice assistants as assistive technologies. This publication will contain the research findings, written in an accessible language to disseminate the insights for a broader and interested public. Its aim is to substantially improve adoption and design processes regarding voice assistants as assistive technologies.
